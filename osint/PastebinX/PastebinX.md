To be fair, the challenge is worded poorly (maybe besides the title?!)

The "ID" is referring to the twitter ID of an account that was found in the comments section of the pastebin challenge.

Simply use a twitter ID search website (I used: https://tweethunter.io/twitter-id-converter)

Then put the ID in the flag format, and you get the flag.

Final flag: `n00bz{1d_1596757063039799297}`

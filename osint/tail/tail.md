Description:
>Here's a picture of a plane's tail. Can you find the airline's hub (the airport where they mostly operate from). Use the three letter airport IATA code and wrap it in n00bz{}. Example: n00bz{SFO}. Author: NoobMaster

# Easy way:
Put the image into chatgpt. Instantly recognizes the airline, hub, and the IATA code.

# Tougher way:

Reversing the image does nothing due to the quality. Googling "airplane with blue tail and white flower" leads me to a [Pinterest](https://www.pinterest.com/pin/98797785561387859/) page that has the airline of Air Tahiti Nui's. 
Going to the [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_Tahiti_Nui) page of the airline shows the hub as "Faa'a International Airport". Now google the IATA code, and you get your flag. 

Final flag: `n00bz{PPT}`

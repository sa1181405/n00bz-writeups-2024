# Solution

A lot of information can be gathered from The Hangout Discord server (see gang 3 writeup). Searching on flightstats.com using the date (3 Aug), time (~1 pm arrival), arrival airport (Bengaluru, BLR), airline (Air India) and knowing the other airport is in Delhi, we find [this flight](https://www.flightstats.com/v2/flight-tracker/AI/506?year=2024&month=8&date=3&flightId=1266296156%20?!).

"Long time back" refers to the wayback machine.

Simply put the pastebin link into the wayback machine. You will see a [date](https://web.archive.org/web/20240617125911/https://pastebin.com/j1UnKA7m) for June 17th.

Clicking on it shows the old paste, which is the flag.

Final flag: `n00bz{l0ng_t1m3_ag0_m34ns_w4yb4ck}`

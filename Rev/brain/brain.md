Help! A hacker said that this "language" has a flag but I can't find it! Author: NoobMaster

# Solution

I did this by hand. I used a bf decoder, and decoded each line before `<[-]>`. Then looked at the memory, this revealed each character of the flag. Concatenate all the letters/symbols/numbers to get the flag.

Final flag: `n00bz{1_c4n_c0d3_1n_br41nf*ck!}`
